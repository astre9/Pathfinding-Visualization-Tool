# Pathfinding-Visualization-Tool
JS Pathfinding Project

I've challenged myself in developing a pathfinding visualization tool as fast as possible, the work presented here was done in less than a week so it's prone to updates in the future.

The tools used in creating this are as follows:

• Languages: Plain Javascript, HTML, CSS;

• Editor: Visual Studio Code;

• Libraries: Lottie for the animated icons and FeatherIcons for the static;

In order to achieve this I've used several algorithms, all adapted to my personal implementation in Javascript.

TUTORIAL

The menu offers multiple options for customizing the way an algorithm is visualized. The first step is selecting which algorithm (BFS/DFS) you want to work with, followed by the addition of a random generated pattern to block the way the algorithm finds a path. Also the speed in which the grid is traversed can be selected from within the speed dropdown.
